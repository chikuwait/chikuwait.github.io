<p>
I'm a first-year Ph.D student at the Graduate School of Systems Information Science, Future University Hakodate. 
My advisors are <a href='https://www.fun.ac.jp/en/faculty/inamura-hiroshi'>Prof. Hiroshi Inamura</a> and <a href='https://www.fun.ac.jp/en/faculty/matsubara-katsuya'>Prof. Katsuya Matsubara</a>.
In addition, I'm working full-time on research and development at Research Center, SAKURA internet Inc.
Our company provides cloud computing, GPU-based high-performance computing environments, and data centers for the Japanese government, corporations, and private customers.
</p>
<p>
My Research interests are mainly system software for cloud-computing, Edge-computing, and distributed computing, such as Operating Systems, Virtualization, Software Defined Networking, and Programming Language Runtime.
My graduation thesis topic was "A Robust and Light-weight Isolation for Containers with Assists of Hardware Virtualization Technology".
My master thesis topic was "Concentrated Network Isolation for Containerized Cloud Services".
</p>

<p>
I'm currently interested in WebAssembly (Wasm) for architecture-independent software execution runtime of the Edge-to-Cloud continuum.
My research topic for my Ph.D. course and our company is architecture, runtime, and execution method(e.g., Just-In-Time, Ahead-Of-Time, and Interpreter) neutral Live-migration of Wasm VM.
